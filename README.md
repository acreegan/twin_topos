# twin_topos

Twin Topos is a website that allows you to compare the sizes of two different places. It works by displaying two Google Maps windows side by side, with the scales of the two maps linked. If you change the zoom of one map, the zoom level of the other will be automatically adjusted to match the scale. 

Twin Topos is hosted on https://twintopos.com/
